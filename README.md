# DnD5e-CombatSimulator
D&amp;D 5e Creature Combat Simulator

A (Python 3.6) script for simulating Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition encounters between creatures. No external libraries needed.

## Why does this exist?
This script is mainly created as a DM tool for simulating encounters between different types of creatures. Want to know how a level 8 Barbarian with a magical Greataxe +2 and his Dire Wolf companion can stand against a Mammoth? How about a Purple Worm vs. 30 zombies? Just run the script and see.

## Features
- Movement in three-dimensional world (flying/burrowing not yet implemented)
- Possibility to create battles between parties of arbitrary size
- Create approximations of player characters by combining already defined creature, ability and weapon objects (see *definitions.py*)
- Most of the crucial D&D mechanics defined

## Caveats
Creature behavior is very straightforward. Thus the results are not always comparable one-to-one to Pen & Paper encounters.
